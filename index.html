            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Laila Monette and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite 
                (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.

                <p>
                    Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business presents to the world, 
                    including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a cohesive and impactful brand that resonates with your target audience and sets 
                    you apart from your competitors.$X,XXX
